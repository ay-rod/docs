This will download the pricing-table component in your `/components` directory. You can swap `clean` for `classic` or `dev` if you want to use a different style. View them all at [pricecn.com](https://pricecn.com).

## Define your product schema

Pricing components can be involved and tricky to manage on the frontend, especially when pricing changes happen. `pricing-table` can automatically generate based on a simple product schema you define.

```javascript
type Product = {
  id: string, //an ID you'll pass into a <PricingCard> to render it
  name: string, //the name of the product (eg, Pro)
  description?: string, //product description
  recommendedText?: string, //for emphasized products (eg, "Best Value")
  price: {
    primaryText: string, //product main price
    secondaryText?: string, //pricing details (eg, per user, per month)
  },
  priceAnnual?: {
    primaryText: string, //annual price variant
    secondaryText?: string, //pricing details for the annual variant
  },
  buttonText: string, //text for the <PricingCard> button
  everythingFrom?: string, //renders a "Everything from X, and" string
  items: {
    primaryText: string, //features available, (eg, 5 seats included)
    secondaryText?: string, //extra text, usually for pricing (eg, then $10USD per seat)
  }[], //items is an array
};
```

<Note>LLMs are good at auto generating this schema from a screenshot\!</Note>

## Usage

An example usage of `<PricingTable />` will be downloaded as `components/pricing/example.tsx`. This file demonstrates how to define your products and pass them into the `PricingTable` component.

```javascript
import { PricingTable, PricingCard, Product } from "./pricing-table";

export const products: Product[] = [
  {
    id: "hobby",
    name: "Hobby",
    description: "For personal projects and small-scale applications.",
    price: { primaryText: "Free", secondaryText: "up to 3 users" },
    buttonText: "Start deploying",
    items: [
      { primaryText: "Deploy full-stack apps in minutes" },
      { primaryText: "Fully-managed datastores" },
      // ...more features
    ],
  },
  // ...more products
];

export const PricingTableExample = () => (
  <PricingTable products={products} showFeatures={true}>
    <PricingCard productId="hobby" />
    <PricingCard productId="professional" />
    <PricingCard
      productId="enterprise"
      buttonProps={{
        onClick: () => {
          console.log("Button Clicked");
        },
      }}
    />
  </PricingTable>
);
```

`<PricingCard>` can also take in `buttonProps` , allowing you to define an `onClick()` function.
